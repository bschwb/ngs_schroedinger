** DONE Add complex space
   CLOSED: [2018-03-08 Thu 21:06]
** DONE All dirichlet boundary conditions?
   CLOSED: [2018-03-08 Thu 21:06]
   Yes. Should work like infinite potential outside.
** DONE Write out variational formulation
   CLOSED: [2018-03-08 Thu 21:12]
** DONE Add bilinearforms
   CLOSED: [2018-03-08 Thu 21:14]
** DONE Random initial value
   CLOSED: [2018-03-08 Thu 21:18]
** DONE Understand eigenvalue solver

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration
** NEXT Implement power iteration
* Ideas
** Use more sophisticated eigen value solvers
See the reference.
Inverse iteration to find more then only the biggest one?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_iteration
How to get the smallest one?
** Use non-square geometry
** 3dimensional!
** Use AMG Preconditioner
** Draw probability density
** Use non-zero potential to demonstrate tunneling!
** Also do 1dimensionl
** Dirac equation
