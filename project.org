Maybe a problem is, that we are looking for the highest eigenvalue,
which corresponds to a highly oscillating eigenfunction.
If we then use a finer mesh, we will get an even higher eigenvalue
with an even more oscillating eigenfunction.
Try looking finding smallest eigenvalue first.
** DONE Research how to find smallest eigenvalue

The i-tutorial [1] says, that the inverse iteration will converge to the smallest eigenvalue.
Why? I mean inverse iteration is shifted somehow.
Is there intuition why not shifted converges to smallest?
kind of bc 1/biggest_ev is smalles etc. of inverse?
So power iteration of inverse (= inverse iteration) would converge to smallest!!!!

** NEXT Solve time-dependent Schrödinger equation
*** DONE What to use as an initial condition?
    CLOSED: [2018-03-10 Sat 22:40]
In [2] a wave packet is used.
*** NEXT Add wave-packet initial condition
*** TODO Add Crank-Nicolson timestep
* Ideas
** Use more sophisticated eigen value solvers
See the reference.
Inverse iteration to find more then only the biggest one?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_iteration
How to get the smallest one?
*** Research how to find more eigenvectors
[1] Has some tricks on how to find more eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Not sure if I should keep solving for eigenvalues, seems pretty boring to show.
** Use non-square geometry
** 3dimensional!
** Use AMG Preconditioner
** Draw probability density
** Use non-zero potential to demonstrate tunneling!
** Also do 1dimensionl
** Dirac equation
