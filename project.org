Maybe a problem is, that we are looking for the highest eigenvalue,
which corresponds to a highly oscillating eigenfunction.
If we then use a finer mesh, we will get an even higher eigenvalue
with an even more oscillating eigenfunction.
Try looking finding smallest eigenvalue first.
** NEXT Research how to find smallest eigenvalue
** TODO Implement finding smallest eigenvalue
* Ideas
** Use more sophisticated eigen value solvers
See the reference.
Inverse iteration to find more then only the biggest one?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_iteration
How to get the smallest one?
** Use non-square geometry
** 3dimensional!
** Use AMG Preconditioner
** Draw probability density
** Use non-zero potential to demonstrate tunneling!
** Also do 1dimensionl
** Dirac equation
